# Exercise: exp
```C
// Compute the exponential function e^x using the Taylor series expansion.
double exponent(float x);
```

- Run `make` to compile and run `exp_tests`, which runs the tests in `exp.c`.
- Run `gdb` on `exp_tests`.
- The comments are all truthful, but don't trust the code.
- Feel free to add tests!
