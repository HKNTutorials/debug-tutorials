# Exercise: square_ints
```C
// Square each element of array (assumed to be size len) and store the results
// in the same array.
void squareArray(int *array, int len);

```

- Run `make` to compile and run `square_ints_tests`, which runs the tests in `square_ints.c`.
- Run `gdb` on `square_ints_tests`.
- The comments are all truthful, but don't trust the code.
- Feel free to add tests!
