# Exercise: floating_point
```C
// sum numbers from start to end with specified increment
float sumRange(float start, float end, float increment);

```

- Run `make` to compile and run `floating_point_tests`, which runs the tests in `floating_point.c`.
- Run `gdb` on `floating_point_tests`.
- The comments are all truthful, but don't trust the code.
- Feel free to add tests!
